Group 36:

1. Open Final folder and run "xgb.R" script for our best prediction model which can be found in the folder “Final”. 

2. Set the working directory to the current path where the files are extracted.

3. Similarly, other models are also included within the folder which lead to somewhat closer predictions.

4. File names and its content
	-loadlibraries.R		:Contain all the required libraries for the proper execution of the model
	-Load_known.R			:Load the known dataset
	-Load_class.R			:Load the class dataset
	-Impute_known.R			:To clean and impute various features present inside the known dataset
	-Impute_class.R			:To clean and impute various features present inside the class dataset
	-glm.R				:Logistic regression prediction model
	-randomForest.R			:Random forest prediction model
	-neuralNetworks.R		:Neural Network prediction model
	-xgb.R				:Xtreme Gradient Boosting prediction model
	-ensembling.R			:Ensemble prediction model
	-IV_step.R			:Information Value gain & Stepwise Regression
	-MARS_Var IMP.R			:Variable importance MARS implementation
	-Var_Imp_Boruto.R		:Variable importance Boruto implementation
	-MARS-Variable Importance 	:Image file for variable importance result
	-Boruto-Variable Importance	:Image file for variable importance result
	-36.csv				:Prediction results

5. Variable Importance codes are preset inside the “Variable Importance” Folder
